We encourage guardians to do their own research ahead of time to ensure the movie is suiting and appropriate for your children. Additionally, all minors should be accompanied by an adult. The Conservancy is not responsible for gauging appropriateness of titles for movie-goers.
 
Unfortunately, no to both. Chairs (other than wheelchairs) are not allowed on the lawn, so please bring your own picnic blanket. Portable stadium-style cushion seats without legs or hard pieces are a great option. Dogs are not allowed on the lawns at any time, per Park rules.
 
For those who require physical accommodations, there is a limited reserved seating area at the top of the lawn (on the hardscape). Please bring your own chair, and see a Conservancy staff member the welcome tent at top of the lawn to inquire.
